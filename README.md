# Arduino-8bit-binary-counter
:red_circle:Display 8bit binary number using arduino

:small_blue_diamond:The LEDs are connected to the 2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11 digital pins in arduino UNO board.

:small_blue_diamond:A potentiometer connected to the A1 analog pin to get value between 0-1023

:small_blue_diamond:The taken value from potentiometer is consider as a 8bit value. And convert it into 1 and 0. 

:small_blue_diamond:Potentiometer Resistance - 220omh

:small_blue_diamond:Led's resistor - 100omh
