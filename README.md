# Arduino-8bit-binary-counter
Display 8bit binary number using arduino

The LEDs are connected to the 2,3,4,5,6,9,10,11 digital pins in arduino UNO board.
A potentiometer connected to the A1 analog pin to get value between 0-1023
The taken value from potentiometer is consider as a 8bit value. And convert it into 1 and 0.
